## Rachel's Project Question - Product Review Analysis
Can we use product reviews as a predictor for sales at REI?  Do product Reviews affect sales?  Furthermore, are there certain key words that drive an increase in orders for a given product?

In order to answer this, I will be using raw data from Bazaarvoice (the vendor we use to capture and enable user generated content on rei.com).  I might also use some internal Adobe/Omniture data too (avg review for products, number of reviews posted).  I plan to look at the relationship between reviews posted and orders placed over time (over the past year).

The Bazaarvoice data holds every single review for products available on rei.com, as well as the average score.  Generally speaking, products with strong reviews sell better than those with weaker/no reviews.  

This is a relevant topic to some questions we want to answer about the importance and impact of our reviews, and could guide REI on future strategy with incentivized product reviews and staff reviews.
